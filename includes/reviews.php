										This place is nuts. It's worth losing your religion over (Being vegan). From the outside the place doesn't look like much, but believe me it's worth going through that door... as soon as you walk in you are greeted with a smile and awesome pictures that confuse the heck out you of what to order. When you first get the food, your eyes are greeted with a beautiful picture, as the food gets closer your smell senses are activated and you know this is going to be heaven. The texture feels nice to the touch oh, I need just don't want to let go of the food, and the climax comes when you actually taste the food, and you can't help but shake your head in pleasure. The only regret is that I didn't order three times the quantity that I actually did.								</p>

									Kings Bakery is by far the best bakery in town. They are always busy so you can call ahead and place your order if needed. Everything is made fresh to order, which may explain the longer wait times. They are my go-to bakery for their mini cheese pizzas. They are amazing!! The meat shawarmas on pita bread (extra toasted) are so flavorful and delicious. They are known for their "manouwich" but I haven't ordered one yet, I hear they are great but I am a simple bread and cheese kind of person.

										My friends & I pulled up right when they were closing. (Wasn't aware of summer hours) The young  gentleman saw how bummed we were and he opened the doors for us just to eat!! We all got the chicken shawarma with seasoned fries and it was delicious!! We were going to take it to go so he didn't have to stay much longer, but he insisted we stayed to eat there. That kind of service is rare but greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Kings Bakery!
